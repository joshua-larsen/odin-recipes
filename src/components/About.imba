			<p.text-xl.mb8> "I plan to combine my passion for sustainability and technology with the network and skills I've acquired at the VFC training camp to build the next generation of innovative technologies to address the impending crises of our time. Currently, I am seeking opportunities with potential for growth in the tech sector, specifically software engineering and sales."
			<p.text-xl.mb8> "In addition to physical challenges, I enjoy taking on learning challenges. No topic is off limits, whether it is the funky world of fermentation or computer programming. I enjoy breaking down silos by learning from people of disparate disciplines and all walks of life. I believe the key to addressing today's most wicked problems is to build diverse teams combining art, design, science and engineering."
