<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Chimichurri is a green sauce used for grilled meat, originally from Argentina. It is made of finely-chopped parsley, minced garlic, olive oil, oregano, and white or red wine vinegar. It is usually served on the side with grilled steak, but it can also be used as a marinade.</p>
